The Personal Task Management Web App helps us to maintain our day to day tasks. Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later.This project would not only help us to develop time management skills but would also help us to develop skills to perform our task in an efficent manner in order to obtain best results.
